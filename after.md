# Doctoral school on Sciences and Technologies of Information and Communication (STIC) of the University Paris Saclay

## After the PhD

The ICST field within the framework of the University of Paris-Saclay has privileged structures to promote relations between PhD students, PhDs and innovative companies. The Systematic and Cap Digital competitiveness clusters, the IRT SystemX, the DigiCosme labex, the VeDeCom Institute, and the Carnot Institutes regularly organize meetings between research and industry, notably to develop thesis topics in an academic-industrial partnership.

The ED STIC also relies on the alumni network to assist doctoral students in their professional integration.

Surveys show a very satisfactory rate of insertion of PhDs, with 33% of PhDs inserted in higher education and research in EPST, 10% inserted in the public sector (other), 43% inserted in the private sector and more than 12% in postdoctoral contracts. Slightly more than 25% of PhDs have a career abroad.

One of the levers allowing to consolidate and even increase the quality of insertion of PhD students is the development of the network of PhD students of the ED STIC of the University of Paris-Saclay. One of the missions of the deputy director in charge of relations with the socio-economic world will be to set up the coordination of existing networks in connection with the actions undertaken at the level of the University Paris-Saclay.
