# Doctoral school on Sciences and Technologies of Information and Communication (STIC) of the University Paris Saclay

## Defense

The thesis defense procedure is described in a general document of the University of Paris-Saclay:

https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/recherche/doctorat-et-hdr/phdâ€¦

At the ED STIC, the management of the defense is the responsibility of the doctoral student's pole. Exchanges must therefore take place with the pole assistant and the pole director.

The language of the thesis is French, except for justified exceptions. To do so, you must send a request with arguments to your pole. An abstract in French of 4000 characters must be attached to the manuscript.

To be able to defend your thesis at ED STIC, you must have published at least one article in an international journal or an international conference with selection committee.

Attention for PhD students who are defending their thesis and who have to re-register: do not start the defense formalities if your re-registration is not finalized.
