The STIC Doctoral School covers a unique thematic continuum in France in the domain of digital technology and science: control, signal processing, image processing, robotics, networks, telecommunications, data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence, human-machine interactions, programming, algorithmics, languages and architecture.

The ED STIC is attached to two Graduate Schools of the University of Paris-Saclay: the Graduate School of Computer Science and the Graduate School of Engineering and Systems Sciences.

The STIC doctoral school is composed of three scientific poles:

- Pole A: Systems and Control, Robotics, Signals, Images, Communications
- Pole B: Big Data, Knowledge, Learning, Interactions
- Pole C: Programming, Models, Algorithms, Architecture, Networks

The e-mail addresses of the poles and the composition of the committees are available in the "Contact" section of the main menu.
