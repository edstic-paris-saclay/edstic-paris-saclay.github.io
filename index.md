## The doctoral school

The STIC Doctoral School covers a unique thematic continuum in France in the domain of digital technology and science: control, signal processing, image processing, robotics, networks, telecommunications, data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence, human-machine interactions, programming, algorithmics, languages and architecture.

The ED STIC is attached to two Graduate Schools of the University of Paris-Saclay: the Graduate School of Computer Science and the Graduate School of Engineering and Systems Sciences.

The STIC doctoral school is composed of three scientific poles:

- Pole A: Systems and Control, Robotics, Signals, Images, Communications
- Pole B: Big Data, Knowledge, Learning, Interactions
- Pole C: Programming, Models, Algorithms, Architecture, Networks

The e-mail addresses of the poles and the composition of the committees are available in the "Contact" section of the main menu.

## Support for training and mobility of doctoral students

The ED STIC and the Graduate School ISN jointly offer financial aid for :

- mobility of PhD students during their thesis. Mobility consists of a stay outside the research unit of the thesis director and that of his/her co-supervisor to work in another laboratory or company, in France or abroad. The assistance provided can be up to 2000 euros (if necessary, the request must be accompanied by a justified co-financing).

- participation of doctoral students in thematic schools or young researcher schools.  The support can be up to 1000 euros (if necessary, the request must be accompanied by a justified co-financing).

In both cases, the support is paid to and managed by the doctoral student's research unit. A doctoral student is eligible only once during his/her thesis for support for a Thematic School.  The cumulative "School" plus "Mobility" support obtained by a PhD student cannot exceed 2000 euros over the PhD period.

For reasons of budget management

- applications for the year N must be sent between January and June of the same year;
- requests for the year N+1 must be sent between July and December of the year N.

You will find below the application form. Once completed, it must be signed by your thesis director and sent by email to formation-edstic@universite-paris-saclay.fr. The title of the mail must be as follows: AAP ED STIC <doctoral_name>.
