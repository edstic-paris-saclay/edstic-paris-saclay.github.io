# Doctoral school on Sciences and Technologies of Information and Communication (STIC) of the University Paris Saclay

## The doctoral project

The doctoral project is a research project carried out by the doctoral student under the direction of one or more experienced researchers (thesis director and possible co-supervisor), usually for a period of 3 years on a full-time basis, within an academic structure (research unit) or in a company providing the scientific and technical skills, as well as the means necessary to carry out the project. The doctoral project initiates a professional project and therefore, professional training is one of the components of the doctoral project.

Finding a doctoral project requires finding a thesis director who is the bearer of a project. The role of the ED STIC is to facilitate the preparation of the doctoral project and to ensure a follow-up from the application to the defense of the doctorate, and even beyond.

## Recruitment

Recruitment is done in two ways:

- by competition for the funding of "white" programs of the university's graduate schools and for certain other labelled funding (for example the UDOPIA program for theses in artificial intelligence).
- without competition for other funding (ANR, CIFRE, CSC ...)

The process is identical for both recruitment methods and consists of the following steps
- submission of a thesis project by a supervisor
- validation of the project by the laboratory
- validation of the project by the ED
- submission of an application for a thesis project
- examination and evaluation of the application by the thesis director
- examination and evaluation of the application by the ED

For the competition and also for some other funding, a specific calendar must be respected. Consult the dedicated page on the University of Paris-Saclay website: https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/recherche/doctorat-et-hdr/fun…

## For supervisors: how to submit and validate a thesis proposal

Whatever the method of recruitment, the thesis project must be submitted by its leader (generally the thesis director) on ADUM. It is not mandatory that the project be financed at the time of submission, however a certificate of financing will be required before the finalization of the recruitment of the doctoral student.

If you are a thesis applicant and wish to submit a project, log in to your ADUM account. Choose "Gestion des propositions de thèse" in the "Propositions de thèse" menu, and then click on "Ajouter une proposition de projet doctoral". The online form appears, where you can indicate all the necessary information about the thesis subject. In case of difficulty, contact your pole (poleXstic@universite-paris-saclay.fr, where X=A, B or C depending on your pole).

After checking the suitability of the project for the applicant's pole, the opinion of the unit director is collected as well as that of one of the members of the pole committee. If the opinions are favourable, the subject is published on ADUM so that students can apply. (For subjects outside the competition, you can reserve the subject for a student. To apply for the subject, the student will have to open an ADUM account using the email address you will have indicated).

The application file must contain a certain number of documents.

If it is an application for the competition (concours), this file must contain an interview report dated and signed by the thesis director, on the model downloadable below:

Formulaire de rapport d'entretien pour le concours - (docx 464.74 Ko)

If it is an application outside of the competition, this file must contain an audition report dated and signed by the members of the admission committee. The form for this report can be downloaded below:

Formulaire de rapport d'audition hors-concours - (docx 481.73 Ko)

It is the thesis director who must take the initiative to form the admission committee. It includes at least two members from outside the supervisory team (the supervisory team is made up of the thesis director and co-supervisors). At least one of these two members must hold the HdR. The committee may also include one or more members of the supervisory team, but the number of external members must be greater than or equal to the number of members of the supervisory team. The members of the admissions committee must be in a position to decide on the applications with the necessary independence and freedom of judgment.

The director of the pole concerned decides on the application in the light of the file and the report of the admissions committee. He or she may be assisted in this decision by one or more members of the pole committee. He or she may contact the thesis director to gather additional information if necessary.

In any case, to guarantee the quality of the thesis supervision and the availability of the supervisors:

- an HdR or equivalent is authorized to supervise a maximum of five doctoral students (number common to all the doctoral schools of the University of Paris-Saclay) with a supervision rate inferior or equal to 300%, and
- a non-HdR is authorized to co-supervise 3 doctoral students with a supervision rate less than or equal to 100% by decision of the ED STIC council.

In the case of co-supervision, international co-supervision, or exceptional situations, the ED STIC board can grant individual waivers after a preliminary examination of each situation. The request for exemption must be sent to the management of the pole concerned. It must include: 

- a letter from the thesis director :
  - presenting the situation and explaining the reasons for exceeding the authorized number or rate of supervision;
  - attesting on his or her honor that all doctoral students already under his or her supervision have been informed of the planned changes in their supervision conditions and explaining why and how these doctoral students as well as newcomers will benefit from the new conditions of supervision and the availability of their thesis director;
  - explaining when and how he or she plans to return to a number or rate of supervision below the authorized limits.
- a letter of support from the laboratory director:
  - attesting on his or her honor that the laboratory council has given a favorable opinion to the reception of a new doctoral student under the proposed supervision conditions;
  - specifying, if necessary, the provisions and support measures that could be taken, in case of difficulty, at the laboratory level.

## For the candidates: application on a thesis project

The candidate applies for a project using ADUM. It is essential that the application be preceded by a direct contact with the thesis project leader and then, in the case of the concretization of the application, by a meeting with him/her.  

Thesis topics are available via the following link: https://www.adum.fr/as/ed/proposition.pl?site=psstic

To apply under Adum, you must visualize the chosen project and click on the "Candidater" button below the project presentation. You will then be asked to fill in a form and to provide a number of documents.

If the subject is already assigned to you by the project leader, the "Candidater" button does not appear. You must apply using the following address: https://www.adum.fr/candidature/index.pl?matricule_prop=. Moreover, to create your ADUM account, you must use the e-mail address that has been indicated for you by the project leader.

In the case of a non-competitive recruitment, an audition will be organized by the person who is carrying the thesis project. You will have to provide in your file an audition report dated and signed by the members of the audition committee. The form that must be filled out by the audition committee can be downloaded above, in the previous section.

In the case of recruitment through the competition, the candidates who will be auditioned will receive an invitation. The audition will take place before the audition committee of the competition.

In all cases, the purpose of the audition is to ensure that the candidate's profile is in line with the project, to measure his or her motivation and ability to carry out the project and more generally to develop a research approach.

## Funding

At ED STIC, any thesis must start with the assurance of a three-year funding. This funding should preferably be formalized by a doctoral contract. The doctoral contract also allows the doctoral student to benefit, if he or she wishes, from a non-research mission. Foreign doctoral students may receive grants from their country of origin. Co-tutored doctoral students must also receive funding over three years to enable them to stay in France under the same conditions as other doctoral students.

The submission of a project can be done with the objective of obtaining funding, either through a competition or outside of a competition (CSC, CIFRE...). The funding can be acquired at the time of submission of the project (ANR contract). In both cases, an attestation of funding is required before finalizing the recruitment/application.
