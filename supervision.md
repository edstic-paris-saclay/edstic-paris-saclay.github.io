# Doctoral school on Sciences and Technologies of Information and Communication (STIC) of the University Paris Saclay

## Supervision

The doctoral project is articulated around

- research training provided by the thesis director and his research unit,  
- a complementary scientific training close to the disciplinary field of the thesis,
- a professional training dedicated to the future professional of the doctor

These training courses are orchestrated by the ED STIC with the support of the doctoral college of the Université Paris Saclay. The ED STIC ensures in particular the follow-up of the PhD students to guide them in their choice and the achievement of their professional project.

## Follow-up of the doctoral student

The objective of the follow-up is to take stock of the progress of the thesis project, to give the doctoral student the opportunity to present his or her work publicly, even at an early stage of progress, to give him or her an outside view of his or her work, complementary to that of his or her supervisors and host team, and to accompany him or her in the construction of his or her professional project. The follow-up also aims to detect as early as possible any difficulties linked to the thesis or to external constraints in order to propose solutions (need for additional training, redefinition of the thesis subject, supervision methods, etc.) and to avoid endangering the doctoral student's initial project.

The ED STIC sets up two types of follow-up :

- the annual follow-up linked to the doctoral student's re-registration,
- the follow-up following a specific problem.

### Annual follow-up

In accordance with article 13 of the decree of May 25, 2016, the doctoral student's individual monitoring committee meets each year before re-enrollment. The request for re-registration in the thesis is examined by the pole's management, which takes into account the opinion of the thesis director and the opinion of the monitoring committee. In the event of difficulty, the pole director takes any necessary measures concerning the situation of the doctoral student and the progress of his/her doctorate. In particular, he or she may request interviews with the doctoral student and/or the supervisory team.

In 2023, the new modalities of individual follow-up presented below do not concern doctoral students who have already completed (in 2022 or before) their "mid-term defense" according to the old modalities. If these doctoral students have to re-enroll in 2023-2024, they will have a preliminary interview with the management of their pole or with members of the pole committee.

All other doctoral students are concerned by what follows below.

As part of the annual follow-up, the doctoral student delivers the following documents

- A document of 3 to 8 pages presenting the subject of the thesis, the progress and the perspectives of the research work. For registration in the third year and beyond, a schedule of activities up to the defense is required. Appendices may be added to the document (e.g. a submitted or published article).
- A CV including all the activities of the doctoral student such as non-research missions (teaching, valorization), stays outside the host team, publications, articles submitted or in preparation, software/prototypes or experiments deployed or in progress,
- A report on the training courses followed (form available below in the "Training" section), and a plan for future training courses.

These documents must be provided to the members of the follow-up committee at least two weeks before the committee meeting. The follow-up booklet (downloadable below) pre-filled in by the doctoral student must also be provided to them, within the same timeframe.

At the meeting of the monitoring committee, the doctoral student makes an oral presentation in the presence of the members of the monitoring committee and the supervisory team. This presentation is followed by an interview by the committee with the doctoral student alone, and an interview with the supervision team alone.

The individual follow-up committee is appointed by the management of the pole concerned during the first months of the thesis, and in all cases before the student re-registers for the second year, on the proposal of the thesis director, in consultation with the doctoral student. In case of disagreement on this composition, the doctoral student informs the pole's management who will decide accordingly. Exceptionally in 2023, an individual follow-up committee will have to be appointed for all doctoral students who have not done a "mid-term defense" in 2022 or before.

In concrete terms, during the first year of the thesis, the thesis director must send to the management of the pole concerned, by the means indicated by the pole, the names and qualities of the persons envisaged to be members of the follow-up committee. This proposal must have been made in consultation with the doctoral student.

Once the composition of the committee has been validated by the pole's management (after possible exchanges), the doctoral student must enter the composition of the follow-up committee in ADUM.

At ED STIC the monitoring committee is composed of two members :

- a member external to the University of Paris-Saclay, specialist in the field of the thesis,
- one member from within the University of Paris-Saclay, not a specialist in the field of the thesis, working in a research unit associated with the ED STIC but not in the same research team as the doctoral student and the supervisory team.

At least one of these persons must hold the HdR or an equivalence. The "referent" to be indicated in ADUM is the internal member of the follow-up committee. In special cases (for example, in the case of a multidisciplinary thesis) a third person may be added to the committee.

The guide for the follow-up committee, which can be downloaded below, gives a lot of information about individual follow-up. It must be sent to the committee members by the thesis director or the doctoral student as soon as its composition is validated by the doctoral school.

At the end of the follow-up committee meeting, the committee members write a report on the booklet below, which has been pre-filled in by the doctoral student.

This report is signed by the members of the follow-up committee and then uploaded in pdf format on ADUM by the referent (the internal member of the committee). The doctoral student and his/her supervisors will then be able to consult it. This report will be required for re-registration (submission on ADUM by the doctoral student).

In case of problems or questions, the committee members can contact the management of the pole concerned: poleXstic@universite-paris-saclay.fr, where X=A, B or C according to the pole to which the thesis is attached.

For a 4th year re-registration that foresees a defense before the end of the current calendar year, a firm commitment from the thesis director on the date of the defense is required. In this case, the appointment of the referees must be made at the time of re-registration.

For a request for registration in the 4th year with a defense beyond 40 months, the request for a waiver must be accompanied by a work plan up to the defense, a commitment to funding up to the sending of the thesis to the rapporteurs and preferably at least until the defense.  An interview can be organized by the director of the pole, in addition to the follow-up committee.

### Follow-up following a specific problem or conflict

A special follow-up is proposed when the doctoral student encounters difficulties or has questions that cannot be addressed with his or her supervisors or close circle, or when the ED STIC is alerted about a conflict.

A series of interviews is organized with the doctoral student alone, with the thesis director and co-supervisors alone, and then all together if necessary in order to propose a solution and verify its relevance. The doctoral school can call on the specialized services of the institutions if necessary. A mediator can be proposed, with the agreement of both parties.  

If this approach is not successful, the doctoral school sets up a conciliation committee whose mission is to develop solutions and make recommendations.

In accordance with the decree of May 25, 2016, as soon as the doctoral school becomes aware of acts of violence, discrimination, moral or sexual harassment or sexist behaviour, it will report them to the institution's anti-discrimination and anti-sexual violence hotline.
