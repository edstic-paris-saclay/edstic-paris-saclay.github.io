# Doctoral school on Sciences and Technologies of Information and Communication (STIC) of the University Paris Saclay

## Training

On February 11, 2022, the Council of theSTIC doctoral school voted the new rules for the validation of the complementary training of doctoral students, in conformity with the rules of the general framework of the Université Paris-Saclay, described in the following document: https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/sites/default/files/media/2021-0…

Transitional measures: these new rules concern doctoral students who have started their thesis as of September 1, 2020. For those who started their thesis before, the old rules still apply, see below. 

For doctoral students who are currently in their second year, a transitional regime will apply and we will implement the new rules with care. In particular, if you have already validated the Ethics & STIC course of the ED, you will not have to take its new version (called Ethics & Open Science) to add the Open Science part.
Complementary training for doctoral students who started their thesis on or after September 1, 2020.

Each doctoral student must accumulate 180 training points over the duration of the thesis. The largest part, 158 points, corresponds to the thesis work which includes in particular the reading of articles, the study of the subject, the associated developments, the writing of publications, the possible participation in conferences and workshops.

The remaining 22 points correspond to the complementary training that each doctoral student must complete during the 3 years of the thesis. They are divided into two categories, corresponding to mandatory and optional training, summarized in the following tables. The number of points due may be reduced on a case-by-case basis depending on the particular situation of the doctoral student (co-tutored thesis, CIFRE thesis, FTLV, etc.) with the agreement of the management of the corresponding pole.

### Compulsory training and activities

|Type of activity 	|Minimum points to be obtained 	|Equivalence/Comment|
|--|--|--|--|
|Ethics and scientific integrity course 	|2 	|Package of 2 points for a course of at least 10h|
|Open science course 	|1 	|Package of 1 point for a course of at least 5 hours|
|Sustainable development course 	|1 	|1 point package for a course of at least 5 hours|
|Scientific courses 	|10 	|1pt = 5h of course, to be chosen among the modules of research Masters, thematic schools, cycles of recognized scientific seminars (for example those of the Collège de France), MOOCs with certification, etc.|
|"Post-doctoral day" organised by ED STIC 	|1 	|1 point|
|ED STIC welcome meeting 	|1 	|1 point|

The points for compulsory activities (minimum 16) must be completed by optional activities to be chosen from the following table.

### Optional courses and activities

|Training or activity 	|Restrictions 	|Equivalence 	|Comment|
|--|--|--|--|
|Language course 	|Maximum 5 points over the duration of the thesis 	|1 point = 5 hours of course| | 	 
|Professionalization course 	|  	|1 point = 5 hours of course 	|CV writing, learning specific computer tools, emotional management, motivation, memory, mental representations, pedagogical alignment, etc.|
|Scientific course 	 | 	|1 point = 5 hours of course 	|In addition to the mandatory courses|
|Involvement in university associations 	|Maximum 3 points over the duration of the thesis 	|  	|Provided that you are at least a member of the office|
|Involvement in councils, committees, juries (excluding teaching) 	|Maximum 3 points over the duration of the thesis | | |	  	 
|Teaching 	|Maximum 5 points over the duration of the thesis 	|1 point for 19h "equivalent TD" 	| | 
|Days of preparation for the professional future 	|Maximum 1 point for the duration of the thesis 	|1 point = 5h     	|In addition to the "post-thesis" day of the ED STIC|
|International mobility 	|Maximum 3 points for the duration of the thesis 	|3 points for a stay of at least 4 consecutive weeks |	 |
|Supervision or co-supervision of trainees 	|Maximum 1 point over the duration of the thesis 	|  	|The country must be different from the country of co-supervision (for co-supervised theses)|

Note: participation in conferences, workshops, days, team seminars, as well as in the organization of events, etc. does not give the right to a validation of training points.

Each doctoral student will have to update before each re-enrolment the Training Report form (BF) below and attach it to his/her re-enrolment file. This form lists the training courses completed with the associated objectives and the blocks of competences (chosen from the list).

- d. training in open science
- e. reinforcing the scientific culture of doctoral students
- f. training in sustainable development
- g. promoting international openness
- h. preparing students for their future career in the scientific sector

List of predefined blocks of competencies (several choices are possible):
- 1 : Design and elaboration of a research and development, study and prospective process ;
- 2 : Implementation of a research and development, study and prospective process;
- 3 : Valorization and transfer of the results of a research and development, studies and prospective process;
- 4 : Scientific and technological watch on an international scale;

Note: The thesis work and additional training must eventually cover all 6 skill blocks.

Complementary training modalities for doctoral students who started their thesis before September 1st 2020.

The rules in force before, described in the French part of the website, remain valid for these doctoral students until the end of their thesis.
